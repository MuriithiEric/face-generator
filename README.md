# 👨👩 Flutter Random Face Generator

A flutter app to generate random faces. The Generated faces do not actually exist in real life (in other words you could catfish without getting in trouble 😉 jk jk pls don't catfish). This app uses the [thispersondoesnotexist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and the [fakeface](https://hankhank10.github.io/fakeface/) api.
Each image has been pre-analyzed by an AI algorithm called [pypy-agender](https://github.com/aristofun/py-agender) to identify the gender and age.

Please star⭐ the repo if you like what you see😊.
